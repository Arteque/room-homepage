## The "Room Homepage" challenge from Frontend Mentor
The challenge is to build out an e-commerce homepage based on the design downloaded from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/room-homepage-BtdBY_ENq/hub) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

Im working on only a Homepage so im goin to use plane HTML Scss/css and Javscript for this one
